        <h2>HTML</h2>
        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard 
        markup language for documents designed to be displayed
         in a web browser. It defines the content and structure
          of web content. It is often assisted by technologies 
          such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting 
          languages such as JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p id="b">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language 
        used for specifying the presentation and styling of a 
        document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML 
        (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
         CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, 
         alongside HTML and JavaScript.

    <p id="c">
        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language
         that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, 
         prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
          multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
           programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
            for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
             and the Document Object Model (DOM).
    </p>

    <p id="d">
        <h2>Frameworks</h2>
        Application frameworks became popular with the rise of graphical 
        user interfaces (GUIs), since these tended to promote a standard 
        structure for applications. Programmers find it much simpler to create 
        automatic GUI creation tools when using a standard framework, since this
         defines the underlying code structure of the application in advance. 
         Developers usually use object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques to 
         implement frameworks such that the unique parts of an application can simply 
         inherit from classes extant in the framework
    </p>

    <p id="e">
        <h2>WWW</h2>
        The World Wide Web (WWW or simply the Web) is an information 
        system that enables content sharing over the Internet through
         user-friendly ways meant to appeal to users beyond IT specialists 
         and hobbyists.[1] It allows documents and other web resources to be 
         accessed over the Internet according to specific rules of the Hypertext 
         Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    </p>

    <p id="f">
        <h2>Internet</h2>
        The Internet (or internet)[a] is the global system of interconnected computer
         networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP)[b] to communicate between 
         networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and 
         government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical 
         networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the 
         interlinked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.
