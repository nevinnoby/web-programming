  <h2>HTML</h2>
  <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the 
    standard markup language for documents designed to 
    be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and 
    structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies
    such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
    such as JavaScript.Web browsers receive HTML documents from 
    a web server or from local storage and render the documents
    into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of
    a web page semantically and originally included cues for
    its appearance. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML 
    pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
    interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
    HTML provides a means to create structured documents by 
    denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,
    paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML 
    elements are delineated by tags, written using angle 
    brackets. Tags such as  and  directly introduce content 
    into the page. Other tags such as  and  surround and provide
    information about document text and may include sub-element
    tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them 
    to interpret the content of the page.HTML can embed programs written
    in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior
    and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and 
    layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer
    of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the
    use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, 
    known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the 
    element, together with JavaScript

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language 
            used for specifying the presentation and styling of a 
            document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML
            (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1]
            CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, 
            alongside HTML and JavaScript.CSS is designed to enable
            the separation of content and presentation, including layout,
            colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content 
            accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more 
            flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
            characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share 
            formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate 
            .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the 
            structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached 
            to improve the page load speed between the pages that share
            the file and its formatting.Separation of formatting and content
            also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in
            different styles for different rendering methods, such a
            s on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser
            or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices.
            CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content
            is accessed on a mobile device.The name cascading comes 
            from the specified priority scheme to determine which 
            declaration applies if more than one declaration of a property
            match a particular element. This cascading priority scheme 
            is predictable.

      <h2 id="a">XML</h2>
      <p>
        Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language and 
        file format for storing, transmitting, and reconstructing
         arbitrary data. It defines a set of rules for encoding 
         documents in a format that is both human-readable and 
         machine-readable. The World Wide Web Consortium's XML 1.0 
         Specification[2] of 1998[3] and several other related 
         specifications[4]—all of them free open standards—define XML
         The main purpose of XML is serialization, i.e. storing, transmitting, 
         and reconstructing arbitrary data. For two disparate systems 
         to exchange information, they need to agree upon a file format. 
         XML standardizes this process. It is therefore analogous to a 
         lingua franca for representing information.[8]: 1 As a 
         markup language, XML labels, categorizes, and structurally 
         organizes information.[8]: 11  XML tags represent the data 
         structure and contain metadata. What's within the tags is 
         data, encoded in the way the XML standard specifies.[8]: 
         11  An additional XML schema (XSD) defines the necessary 
         metadata for interpreting and validating XML. 
         (This is also referred to as the canonical schema.)[8]: 
         135  An XML document that adheres to basic XML rules is 
         "well-formed"; one that adheres to its schema is "valid.

<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>
    JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10]
Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM)

<h2>Webpage</h2>
<p>
    web page (or webpage) is a document on the Web that is accessed in a web browser.[1] A website typically consists of many web pages linked together under a common domain name. The term "web page" is thus a metaphor of paper pages bound together into a book.
    Each web page is identified by a distinct Uniform Resource Locator (URL). When the user inputs a URL into their web browser, the browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then transforms it into an interactive visual representation on the user's screen.[2]
If the user clicks or taps a link, the browser repeats this process to load the new URL, which could be part of the current website or a different one. The browser has features, such as the address bar, that indicate which page is displayed.
